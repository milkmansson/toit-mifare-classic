Crypto-1 cipher and PRNG.

# Cipher
Crypto-1 is a stream cipher used in Mifare Classic RFID cards.

At its core the cipher is a 48-bit linear feedback shift register (LFSR) with
  generating polynomial g(x) = x⁴⁸ + x⁴³ + x³⁹ + x³⁸ + x³⁶ + x³⁴ + x³³ + x³¹
  + x²⁹ + x²⁴ + x²³ + x²¹ + x¹⁹ + x¹³ + x⁹ + x⁷ + x⁶ + x⁵ + 1.

At any time k, the state sₖ of the LFSR is given by the 48-bit value
  sₖ=xₖxₖ₊₁…xₖ₊₄₇. At time k+1, the LFSR's state is updated to
  sₖ₊₁=xₖ₊₁xₖ₊₂…xₖ₊₄₈ by shifting the bits by one and adding
  xₖ₊₄₈ = xₖ⊕xₖ₊₅⊕xₖ₊₉⊕xₖ₊₁₀⊕xₖ₊₁₂⊕xₖ₊₁₄⊕xₖ₊₁₅⊕xₖ₊₁₇⊕xₖ₊₁₉⊕xₖ₊₂₄⊕xₖ₊₂₇⊕xₖ₊₂₉⊕xₖ₊₃₅⊕xₖ₊₃₉⊕xₖ₊₄₁⊕xₖ₊₄₂⊕xₖ₊₄₃.
During initialization r₊₄₈ is furthermore xored with input bits. See below in the Mifare
  authentication section.

Note that xₖ₊₄₈ is fundamentally a parity check on a subset of the bits xₖ…xₖ₋₄₇ (called "taps").
  Representing the state sₖ as a 48-bit integer (with xₖ being the most significant bit), the
  bit xₖ₊₄₈ (shifted in at the right) can be computed as the parity of
  sₖ & 0b100001000110101101010000110101000001000101110000 = sₖ & 0x846B50D41170

For encryption, the LFSR state is filtered through a function f, defined as
  f(x₀x₁…x₄₇) = f_c(v1, v2, v3, v4, v5), where
  v1 = f_b(x₉, x₁₁, x₁₃, x₁₅),
  v2 = f_a(x₁₇, x₁₉, x₂₁, x₂₃),
  v3 = f_a(x₂₅, x₂₇, x₂₉, x₃₁),
  v4 = f_b(x₃₃, x₃₅, x₃₇, x₃₉),
  v5 = f_a(x₄₁, x₄₃, x₄₅, x₄₇).

The truth tables of functions f_a, f_b and f_c are given below:

```
y₄ y₃ y₂ y₁ y₀ | f_a(y₀, y₁, y₂, y₃)  |  f_b(y₀, y₁, y₂, y₃)  |  f_c(y₀, y₁, y₂, y₃, y₄)

Note: The tables have an equal number of 0 and 1 entries.

Reading the individual bits of the truth table, we can represent the functions with the
  following hex values:

- f_a: 0x9E98 = 0b1001111010011000
- f_b: 0xB48E = 0b1011010010001110
- f_c: 0xEC57E80A = 0b11101100010101111110000000001010


# Pseudo Random Number Generator
The PRNG of the Crypto1 library is used to generate nonces.

The Mifare PRNG is a 32-bit value. It is updated at each clock cycle by feeding in
  a new bit at the right (or by setting its seed entirely from the outside). The
  new bit is generated as a function of the least significant 16 bits using again
  a LFSR.

In the literature, shifting in a new bit is called the "suc" function.
  Depending on the literature, the `suc` function does 32 or just one iterations. It
  is generally clear from the context which notation is used.

Multiple iterations are written with a superposed integer:
- suc⁶⁴ (or suc²) corresponds to 64 iterations, and
- suc⁹⁶ (or suc³) to 96 iterations.

Since new bits only depend on the least significant 16 bits, the full 32-bit
  value only has a period of 2^16, and the most significant 16 bits can
  be used to recompute the least significant 16 bits. This is a major
  weakness of the Mifare PRNG, which is actively exploited.

The LFSR of the PRNG is defined by the polynomial x¹⁶ + x¹⁴ + x¹³ + x¹¹ + 1.
At any time k, the state sₖ of the LFSR is given by the 16-bit value
  sₖ=xₖxₖ₊₁…xₖ₊₁₅. At time k+1, the LFSR's state is updated to
  sₖ₊₁=xₖ₊₁xₖ₊₂…xₖ₊₁₆ by shifting the bits by one and adding xₖ₊₁₆ = xₖ⊕xₖ₊₂⊕xₖ₊₃⊕xₖ₊₅.

The LFSR of the PRNG can be implemented the same way as the one of the cipher, with
  taps on x₀, x₂, x₃ and x₅. As such, a PRNG state transition
  can be done by a bit-and of 0b10110100_00000000 = 0xB400 with the current state,
  followed by shifting in the parity of the result.

The LFSR state is initialized with a 32-bit seed. In early versions of Mifare cards,
  the seed was only dependent on the time since when the tag was powered on.

Given a period of just 65535, and since shifts happen every 9.44µs, it cycles every
  618ms.

# Mifare authentication
The following protocol is used to authenticate a Mifare Classic card:

During selection, the tag already shared its UID 'u' with the reader. Both
  sides are in possesion of this 4-byte value.

The goal of the authentication is to establish a shared encrypted communication
  using the sector key 'k'.

Both sides initialize the LFSB state (x₀x₁…x₄₇) with the key 'k'.

The reader initiates the authentication by sending an authentication request (`0x60`
  or `0x61`) for a specific sector.

The tag responds with a random 4-byte value, the challenge n_T. The challenge is
  normally generated by the PRNG. Fundamentally, there isn't any requirement for
  that, though.

If the tag was already authenticated, a nested authentication takes place. In this
  case the tag encrypts the tag n_T while sending it. It starts by
  combining UID⊕nonce_tag (32 bits), then encrypts each bit of n_T, before it
  shifts in the next bit of the xored value.
if the tag was not authenticated, it sends the challenge n_T unencrypted. It still
  shifts in the xored value. The output of the filter function f is ignored in this
  case.
In total, the LFSR is updated 32 times, with the shifted-in bit being xored with the
  result of the combined n_T and u.

The reader uses the n_T to get to the same state as the tag. If the authentication
  is not nested, it just shifts in the xored value (similarly to how the tag did it).
If the authentication is nested, it first decrypts each bit of the challenge n_T,
  then shifts in the next bit of the xored value.

The reader then constructs a 4-byte challeng n_R by . It sends this challenge to the
  tag, using the stream cipher to encrypt it. At the same time, the reader also
  feeds the unencrypted n_R into its own LFSR (similar to how n_T⊕u was fed
  into the LFSR). That is, after encoding each bit of n_R, the reader xors the
  unencrypted bit with the result of the LSFR feedback and uses it to shift the
  LFSR state.
In the same communication, the reader also sends the response to the challenge n_T,
  which is the suc⁶⁴(n_T) (that is, the PRNG value after 64 iterations, where the
  seed was n_T). The challenge response is sent encrypted using the normal
  stream cipher.

The tag decrypts the challenge n_R, and feeds the unencrypted bits into the LFSR as
  soon as they are available. It also verifies that the challenge response is correct.
It finishes the authentication by sending suc⁹⁶(n_T) (that is, the PRNG value
  after 96 iterations) to the reader.

At this stage the cipher has been initialized and both sides share the same LFSR state.
All further messages are encrypted using the output of the filter bits.

The tag finishes the authentication by sending the n_R back to the reader.
